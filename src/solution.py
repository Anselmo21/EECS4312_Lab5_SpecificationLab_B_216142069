Stub file for the is allocation feasible exercise.

Implement the function `is_allocation_feasible` to determine whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied
given limited capacities.

Assumptions (reasonable/consistent format):
- `resources` maps resource names to non-negative numeric capacities.
- Each request is a dict mapping resource names to numeric required amounts.
- Requests are interpreted as *simultaneous* (i.e., total demand per resource is the sum across all requests).
- Any resource not present in `resources` has capacity 0 (so any positive request for it makes allocation infeasible).
